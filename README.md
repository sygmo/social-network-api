# Social Network API

Developer: Sydney Mercier

For: UT Austin Coding Bootcamp

## Overview

This API was designed for a social network web application where users could create a friend list, share their thoughts, and react to friends' thoughts. It uses Express for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The demo below shows the routes being tested in Insomnia.

## Demo

## Future Development

The purpose of the original assignment was merely to get a back-end running, but I would love to return to this someday and give it a functional front-end.
